# Burman Enterprises Assessment Project

This project provides a simple Node.js application for assessment purposes. This README will guide you through setting up, running, and interacting with the application's core functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    If you received this project as a Git repository, clone it to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [project_directory]
    ```
    (Replace `[repository_url]` and `[project_directory]` with the actual values.)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    From the project's root directory in your terminal, install the necessary dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
This command will start the Node.js server, which typically listens on **port 3000**. You should see a confirmation message in your terminal indicating that the server is running.

## Project Functionality

### Salary Process Route

The core functionality of this application is exposed via the `/process` route. This route is designed to handle the salary processing logic.

* **Route:** `http://localhost:3000/process`
* **Method:** This route is typically accessed via a **GET** or **POST** request, depending on the specific implementation for initiating the salary process.

### Testing the Salary Process Route

You can test the salary process route directly from your terminal using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/process
```
